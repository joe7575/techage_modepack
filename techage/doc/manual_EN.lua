  "Tech Age is a technology mod with 4 development stages:\n"..
  "\n"..
  "TA1: Iron Age\n"..
  "Use tools and aids such as coal burners\\, coal burners\\, gravel sieves\\, hammers and hoppers to mine and process the necessary ores and metals.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "TA2: Steam Age\n"..
  "Build a steam engine with drive axles and use it to operate your first ore processing machines.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "TA3: Oil Age\n"..
  "Find and extract oil\\, built railways for oil transportation. A power plant provides the necessary electricity for your machines. Electric light illuminates your industrial plants.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "TA4: Future Age\n"..
  "Renewable energy sources such as wind\\, sun and biofuels help you to leave the oil age. With modern technologies and intelligent machines you set out into the future.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Note: With a click on the plus sign you get into the subchapters of this manual.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "This documentation is available both \"ingame\" (block construction plan) and on GitHub as MD files.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - Link: https://github.com/joe7575/techage/wiki\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The construction plans (diagrams) for the construction of the machines and the pictures are only available in-game.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "With Tech Age you have to start over. You can only create TA2 blocks with the items from TA1\\, for TA3 you need the results from TA2\\, etc.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "In TA2\\, the machines only run with drive axes.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "From TA3\\, the machines run on electricity and have a communication interface for remote control.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "TA4 adds more power sources\\, but also higher logistical challenges (power lines\\, item transport).\n"..
  "\n",
  "Techage adds some new items to the game:\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - Meridium - an alloy for the production of luminous tools in TA1\n"..
  "  - Usmium - an ore that is mined in TA2 and needed for TA3\n"..
  "  - Baborium - a metal that is needed for recipes in TA3\n"..
  "  - Petroleum - is needed in TA3\n"..
  "  - Bauxite - an aluminum ore that is needed in TA4 to produce aluminum\n"..
  "  - Basalt - arises when water and lave touch\n"..
  "\n",
  "Meridium is an alloy of steel and mesecons crystals. Meridium ingots can be made with the coal burner from steel and mesecons crystals. Meridium glows in the dark. Tools made of Meridium also light up and are therefore very helpful in underground mining.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Usmium only occurs as nuggets and can only be obtained by washing gravel with the TA2/TA3 gravel washing system.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Baborium is only extracted in underground mining. Baborium can only be found in stone at an altitude between -250 and -340 meters.\n"..
  "Baborium can only be melted in the TA3 Industrial Furnace.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Petroleum can only be found with the help of the Explorer and extracted with the help of appropriate TA3 machines. See TA3.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Bauxite is only extracted in underground mining. Bauxite is only found in stone at a height between -50 and -500 meters.\n"..
  "It is required for the production of aluminum\\, which is mainly used in TA4.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Basalt is only created when lava and water come together.\n"..
  "The best thing to do is to set up a system where a lava and a water source flow together.\n"..
  "Basalt is formed where both liquids meet.\n"..
  "You can build an automated basalt generator with the Sign Bot.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..

  "\n",
  "TA1 is about mining sufficient ores and producing charcoal with simple tools and equipment\\, so that TA2 machines can be manufactured and operated.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Of course\\, for an iron age there must also be iron and not just steel\\, as in \"Minetest Game\". As a result\\, some recipes have been changed so that iron has to be produced first and then steel later.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The durability of the tools is based on the ages and therefore does not correspond to the original Minetest game.\n"..
  "The durability / hardness for an axe\\, for example:\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - Bronze: 20\n"..
  "  - Steel: 30\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "You need the Charcoal Pile to make charcoal. Charcoal is required for the melting furnace\\, but also\\, for example\\, in TA2 for the steam engine.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Building instructions (see also plan):\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - Build a 5x5 area of ​​dirt\n"..
  "  - Place a lighter in the middle\n"..
  "  - Build a 3x3x3 cube above it out of wood\n"..
  "  - Cover everything with a layer of dirt to form a 5x5x5 cube\n"..
  "  - Leave a hole to the lighter\n"..
  "  - Light the lighter and immediately close the hole with a block of wood and dirt\n"..
  "  - If you have done everything correctly\\, the coal burner will start smoking after a few seconds\n"..
  "  - Only open the charcoal burner when the smoke has disappeared (approx. 20 min)\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Then you can remove the 9 charcoal blocks and refill the Charcoal Pile.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "You need the melting furnace\\, for example\\, to melt iron and other ores in the melting pot. There are different recipes that require different temperatures. The higher the melting tower\\, the hotter the flame. A height of 11 blocks above the base plate is for all recipes\\, but a burner with this height also requires more charcoal.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Building instructions (see also plan):\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - Build a stone tower (cobble) with a 3x3 base (7-11 blocks high)\n"..
  "  - Leave a hole open on one side at the bottom\n"..
  "  - Put a lighter in it\n"..
  "  - Fill the tower with charcoal from the top to the top\n"..
  "  - Light the lighter through the hole\n"..
  "  - Place the melting pot in the flame over the tower\n(one block above the flame)\n"..
  "  - To stop the burner\\, temporarily close the hole with an dirt block\\, for example.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The melting pot has its own menu of recipes and an inventory where you have to put the ores in.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "TA1 has its own tools such as hammer and gravel sieve\\, but the Minecart Hopper can also be used.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The TA1 hammer can be used to knock/dig stone in a mine\\, but also to smash cobble to gravel. The hammer is available in different versions and therefore different properties: bronze\\, steel\\, brass and diamond.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Ores can be sifted from the gravel with the gravel sieve. To do this\\, click on the sieve with the gravel. The sifted gravel and ores fall out below.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "In order not to stand at the sieve for hours\\, sieving can be automated with the hopper.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The hopper from the \"Minecart\" mod is primarily used for loading and unloading Minecarts. He sucks in items from above and passes them on to the right. Therefore\\, when placing the hopper\\, pay attention to the direction of dispensing.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The hopper can also pull items from boxes (chest)\\, provided the box is next to or on the hopper.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The hopper can also put items in boxes if the box is next to the hopper.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "With the help of two boxes\\, two hoppers and a gravel sieve\\, the sieving process can be automated. The plan on the right shows the structure.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Make sure that the boxes are \"chest_locked\"\\, otherwise someone will steal the valuable ores from the box below.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "TA1 has its own metal alloy meridium. Meridium ingots can be made with the coal burner from steel and mesecons crystals. Meridium glows in the dark. Tools made of Meridium also light up and are therefore very helpful in underground mining.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "TA2 is about building and operating the first machines for processing ores. Some machines have to be driven via drive axles. To do this\\, you need to build a steam engine and heat it with coal or charcoal.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "In TA2 there is also a gravel rinser that can be used to wash out rare ores such as Usmium nuggets. You will need these nuggets later for further recipes.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The steam engine consists of several blocks and must be assembled as shown in the plan on the right. The blocks TA2 fire box\\, TA2 boiler top\\, TA2 boiler bottom\\, TA2 cylinder\\, TA2 flywheel and steam pipes are required.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "In addition\\, drive axles and gear blocks are required for changing direction. The flywheel must be connected to all machines that have to be driven via the drive axles.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Always pay attention to the alignment of all blocks when placing:\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - Cylinder on the left\\, flywheel on the right\n"..
  "  - Connect steam pipes where there is a corresponding hole\n"..
  "  - Drive axle on flywheel only on the right\n"..
  "  - In all machines\\, the drive axles can be connected on all sides\\, which is not occupied by other functions\\, such as the IN and OUT holes in the grinder and sieve.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The boiler must be filled with water. Fill up to 10 buckets of water in the boiler.\n"..
  "The fire box must be filled with coal or charcoal.\n"..
  "When the water is hot (temperature display at the top)\\, the steam engine can be started on the flywheel.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The steam engine has a capacity of 25 ku\\, so it can drive several machines at the same time.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Part of the steam engine.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The fire box must be filled with coal or charcoal. The burning time depends on the power demanded by the steam engine. Coal burns for 32 s and charcoal for 96 s under full load.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Part of the steam engine. Must be filled with water. This is done by clicking on the boiler with a water bucket. When there is no more water or the temperature drops too low\\, the steam engine switches off.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Part of the steam engine.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Drive part of the steam engine. The flywheel must be connected to the machines via drive axles.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Part of the steam engine. The boiler must be connected to the cylinder via the steam pipes. The steam pipe has no branches\\, the maximum length is 12 m (blocks).\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The drive axles are used to transmit power from the steam engine to other machines. The maximum length of a drive axis is 8 blocks. With TA2 Gearboxes\\, larger distances can be bridged\\, and branches and changes of direction can be realized.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The TA2 Power Generator is required to operate lamps or other power consumers on a steam engine. The TA2 Power Generator has to be connected to drive axles on one side and then supplies electricity on the other side.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "If the Power Generator is not supplied with sufficient power\\, it goes into an error state and must be reactivated with a right-click.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The Power Generator takes max. 25 ku of axle power and provides on the other side max. 24 ku as electricity. So he consumes one ku for the conversion.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "In order to transport objects from one processing station to the next\\, pushers and tubes are used. See plan.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Two machines can be connected with the help of a pusher and a tube. Tubes have no branches. The maximum length is 200 m (blocks).\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Alternatively\\, tubes can be placed using the Shift key. This allows\\, for example\\, tubes to be laid in parallel without them accidentally connecting.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The transport capacity of a tube is unlimited and only limited by the pusher.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "A pusher is able to pull items out of boxes or machines and push them into other boxes or machines. In other words\\, there must be one and exactly one pusher between two blocks with inventory. Multiple pushers in a row are not possible.\n"..
  "In the opposite direction\\, however\\, a pusher is permeable for items\\, so that a box can be filled via a tube and also taught.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "A pusher goes into the \"standby\" state if it has no items to push. If the output is blocked or the recipient's inventory is full\\, the pusher goes into the \"blocked\" state. The pusher automatically comes out of both states after a few seconds if the situation has changed.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The processing power of a TA2 pusher is 2 items every 2 s.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The distributor is able to transport the items from his inventory sorted in up to four directions. To do this\\, the distributor must be configured accordingly.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The distributor has a menu with 4 filters with different colors\\, corresponding to the 4 outputs. If an output is to be used\\, the corresponding filter must be activated via the \"on\" checkbox. All items that are configured for this filter are output via the assigned output. If a filter is activated without items being configured\\, we are talking about an \"unconfigured\"\\, open output.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "*Attention: The distributor is also a pusher at its output sides. Therefore\\, never pull items out of the distributor with a pusher!*\n"..
  "\n"..
  "There are two operating modes for a non-configured output:\n"..
  "\n"..
  "1) Output all items that cannot be output to any other exit\\, even if they are blocked.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "2) Only output the items that have not been configured for any other filter.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "In the first case\\, all items are always forwarded and the distributor does not run full. In the second case\\, items are held back and the distributor can run full and then block.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The operating mode can be set using the \"blocking mode\" checkbox.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The processing power of a TA2 distributor is 4 items every 2 s\\, whereby the distributor tries to distribute the 4 items to the open outputs.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The gravel washer is a more complex machine with the goal of washing Usmium nuggets out of sieved gravel. A TA2 rinser with axis drive\\, a hopper\\, a chest and running water are required for the installation.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Structure from left to right (see also plan):\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - A dirt block\\, on top of it the water source\\, surrounded on 3 sides by e.g. glass blocks\n"..
  "  - next to it the gravel rinser\\, if necessary with tube connections for the gravel delivery and removal\n"..
  "  - then the hopper with chest\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The whole thing is surrounded by further glass blocks\\, so that the water flows over the gravel rinser and the hopper and rinsed-out nuggets can be collected again by the hopper.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The gravel washer is able to rinse out the Usmium and copper ores from gravel that has already been sieved\\, provided that this is flushed with water.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Whether the Gravel Rinser works correctly can be tested with sticks if these are placed in the inventory of the Gravel Rinser. These must be rinsed out individually and caught by the hopper.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The processing power is one gravel item every 2 s. The gravel washer needs 3 ku of energy.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Crushing\\, grinding and sieving of cobblestone is used to extract ores. Sieved gravel can also be used for other purposes. Quarry\\, grinder and sieve must be driven and thus installed near a steam engine.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The quarry is used to remove stones and other materials from the underground. The quarry digs a 5x5 block hole. The depth is adjustable.\n"..
  "The processing power is one block every 4 s. The quarry needs 10 ku of energy. The maximum depth is 20 meters. For greater depths see TA3 / TA4.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The grinder is able to grind various rocks\\, but also wood and other items.\n"..
  "The processing power is one item every 4 s. The grinder needs 4 ku of energy.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The gravel sieve is able to sieve gravel to extract ores. The result is partially \"sieved gravel\"\\, which cannot be sieved again.\n"..
  "The processing power is one item every 4 s. The gravel sieve requires 3 ku of energy.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "TA2 machines can not only extract ores\\, but also produce objects.\n"..
  "\n",
  "The autocrafter is used for the automatic production of goods. Everything that the player can produce via the \"Crafting Grid\" can also be done by the autocrafter. To do this\\, the recipe must be entered in the menu of the autocrafter and the necessary ingredients added.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "Ingredients and manufactured goods can be transported in and out of the block via tubes and pushers.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The processing power is one item every 4 s. The autocrafter requires 4 ku of energy.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The electronic fab is a special machine and can only be used for the production of vacuum tubes. Vacuum tubes are required for TA3 machines and blocks.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The processing power is one vacuum tube every 6 s. The electronic fab requires 8 ku of energy.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "",
  "Some recipes require water. So that these recipes can also be processed automatically with the autocrafter\\, water must be provided in buckets. The liquid sampler is used for this. He needs empty buckets and has to be put in the water.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The processing capacity is one water bucket every 8 s. The liquid sampler requires 3 ku of energy.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "The protected chest can only be used by players who can build at this location\\, i.e. who have protection rights. It does not matter who sets the chest.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "Minetest divides the map into so-called map blocks. These are cubes with an edge length of 16x16x16 blocks. Such a map block is always loaded completely by the server\\, but only the blocks around a player are loaded (approx. 2-3 blocks in all directions). In the player's direction of view\\, there are also more map blocks. Only this part of the world is active and only here do plants and trees grow or the machines run.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "With a forceload block you can force the map block in which the forceload block is located to remain loaded as long as you are on the server. When all your farms and machines are covered with Forceload blocks\\, everything is always running.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The map blocks with their coordinates are predefined\\, e.g. (0\\,0\\,0) to (15\\,15\\,15)\\, or (16\\,16\\,16) to (31\\,31\\,31).\n"..
  "You can move a forceload block within a map block as you like\\, the position of the map block remains unchanged.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n",
  "At TA3 it is important to replace the steam-powered machines with more powerful and electric-powered machines.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "To do this\\, you have to build coal-fired power plants and generators. You will soon see that your electricity needs can only be met with oil-powered power plants. So you go looking for oil. Drilling derricks and oil pumps help them get the oil. Railways are used to transport oil to the power plants.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The industrial age is at its peak.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "\n"..

  "  - 'config' is used to configure the pusher\\, analogous to manual configuration via the menu.\nExample: '$send_cmnd(1234\\, \"config\"\\, \"default: dirt\")'\n"..
  "  - 'pull' is used to send an order to the pusher:\nExample: '$send_cmnd(1234\\, \"pull\"\\, \"default: dirt 8\")'\nValues ​​from 1 to 12 are permitted as numbers. Then the pusher goes back to 'stopped' mode and sends an\" off \"command back to the transmitter of the\" pull \"command.\n"..

  "\n"..
  "The rows of chests can no longer be removed. There are two ways to dismantle the chests:\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - Empty and remove the front chest. This unlocks the next chest and can be removed.\n"..
  "  - Empty the front chest so far that all stores contain a maximum of 2000 items. This unlocks the next chest and can be removed.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The chests have an \"order\" checkbox. If this checkbox is activated\\, the stores are no longer completely emptied by a pusher. The last item remains in the store as a default. This results in a fixed assignment of items to storage locations.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The chest can only be used by players who can build at this location\\, i.e. who have protection rights. It does not matter who sets the chest.\n"..
  "\n"..
  "The chest has an additional command for the Lua controller:\n"..
  "\n"..
  "  - 'count' is used to request how many items are in the chest.\nExample 1: '$send_cmnd(CHEST\\, \"count\")' -> Sum of items across all 8 stores\nExample 2: '$send_cmnd(CHEST\\, \"count\"\\, 2)' -> number of items in store 2 (second from left)\n"..
